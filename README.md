# Predicting Box Office Revenue Based on Early Rotten Tomatoes Scores and Social Media Sentiment

**Overview:**

This project aims to build a predictive model for movie box office revenue.  The model leverages early Rotten Tomatoes critic and audience scores, combined with pre-release social media sentiment analysis, to forecast a film's financial performance.  This analysis helps studios make more informed investment decisions by providing a quantitative assessment of potential profitability based on readily available pre-release data.  The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the predictive model.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tweepy (for social media data - if used, otherwise remove)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings from the data analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics and model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., scatter plots showing the correlation between Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office revenue, and potentially other visualizations depending on the analysis performed) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations help illustrate the relationships between the input features and the target variable (box office revenue).  The exact output files and their names may vary depending on the specific analysis performed.


**Data:** (Optional - Add if applicable)

This section could describe the data sources used, including where the data was obtained and any preprocessing steps undertaken.  For example:

"The dataset used in this project comprises box office revenue data from [Source], Rotten Tomatoes scores from [Source], and social media sentiment data collected using Tweepy from Twitter."


**Future Improvements:** (Optional - Add if applicable)

This section can outline potential future enhancements to the project, such as:

* Incorporating additional features (e.g., genre, budget, cast information).
* Exploring alternative machine learning models.
* Improving social media sentiment analysis techniques.
* Implementing a web-based interface for easier user interaction.
